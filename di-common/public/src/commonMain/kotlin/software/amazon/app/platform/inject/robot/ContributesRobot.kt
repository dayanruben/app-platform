/**
 * Robots must be annotated with `@ContributesRobot`. The annotation will generate the necessary
 * code to provide the robot in the dependency graph and allow us to retrieve the robot through the
 * `robot<AbcRobot> { }` function.
 *
 * ```
 * @ContributesRobot(AppScope::class)
 * class AbcRobot : Robot {
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * It's supported to inject dependencies in the constructor. For this the class must be annotated
 * with `@Inject`:
 * ```
 * @Inject
 * @ContributesRobot(AppScope::class)
 * class AbcRobot(
 *     val someDependency: Dependency,
 * ) : Robot() {
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **ATTENTION:** Only `AppScope` is supported for now.
