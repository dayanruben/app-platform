/**
 * A presenter that manages a backstack of presenters that are rendered by SwiftUI's
 * `NavigationStack`. All presenters in this backstack are always active, because `NavigationStack`
 * renders them on stack modification. In SwiftUI this is necessary as views remain alive even when
 * they are no longer visible.
 *
 * A detail of note for this class is that we pass a list of [BaseModel] to the view but receive a
 * list of [Int] back where each integer represents the position of a presenter in the backstack
 * list. This is because to share control of state with `NavigationStack` we need to initialize the
 * `NavigationStack` with a `Binding` to a collection of `Hashable` data values. [BaseModel] by
 * default is not `Hashable` and we cannot extend it to conform to `Hashable` due to current
 * Kotlin-Swift interop limitations. As such in Swift the list of [BaseModel] is converted to a list
 * of indices, which are hashable by default. This should be sufficient to handle most navigation
 * cases but if it is required to receive more information to determine how to modify the presenter
 * backstack, it is possible to create a generic class that implements [BaseModel] and wrap that
 * class in a hashable `struct`.
