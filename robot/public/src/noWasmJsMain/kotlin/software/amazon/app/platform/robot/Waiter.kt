/**
 * Blocks the current thread until the given [block] returns true or the [timeout] occurs. [block]
 * is invoked multiple times with the given [delay] to check the condition. In case of a timeout an
 * [IllegalStateException] is thrown, because the app never transitioned into the expected state.
 * For better error messages [condition] describes what [block] is checking and waiting for.
 *
 * Note that this function should not be called from the main thread. The most common use case is
 * calling it from the instrumentation test thread that is used by default in the test function. The
 * thread this function is invoked in gets blocked and not suspended like a coroutine.
