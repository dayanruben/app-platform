/**
 * Scopes define the boundary our software components operate in. A scope is a space with a
 * well-defined lifecycle that can be created and torn down. Scopes host other service objects and
 * serve as container for them, e.g. DI components. To receive a callback when a scope is created or
 * destroyed the [Scoped] interface can be used.
 *
 * Scopes can have 0-N children. Child scopes have the same or a shorter lifecycle as their parent
 * scope. If the parent scope gets destroyed, then all child scopes are destroyed as well.
 *
 * After a scope has been destroyed it should no longer be used. All methods will throw an exception
 * instead.
